Make it possible to group routes : 

    group("/api", () -> {
        get("/users", UserController::getAll);
        post("/users", UserController::create);
    });

To do that is simple, Update in Router and JoltApplication to expose group(String base, List<Consumer<Route>>);


Rewrite the documentation.

Write a simple README.md that covers : 

Installation
Basic Usage
Configuration
Running the Server

Security 

Middlewares

To be honest, we will need to do both Middlewares and Security together, since they are very similar and both are used to protect the application.
Do we make a difference between Filters and Middlewares ?
