In JoltDispatcherServlet, do the following : Object result = handler.handle(joltCtx); // Instead of Typing result as Object, we should try to either use
                                                     // HttpServletResponse, or, something of our own design. like a Handler.class

Add support to ctx to serve static files, such as : 
    ctx.serve("index.html");
    ctx.serve("image.png");

So basically, the files should be served from "/resources/static" directory. 
We will also the logic that when we have a 'GET' request, if no path is found, we will try to check if that ressource is a static file, and serve it if it is.

CLI to generate basic project.

Package to easily integrate docker (and potentially later docker-compose to have a more complex setup).

Rewrite the documentation.

Write a simple README.md that covers : 

Installation
Basic Usage
Configuration
Running the Server

Security 

Middlewares

To be honest, we will need to do both Middlewares and Security together, since they are very similar and both are used to protect the application.
Do we make a difference between Filters and Middlewares ?
